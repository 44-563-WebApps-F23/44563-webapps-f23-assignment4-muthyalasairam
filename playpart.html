    ENGSTRAND. What do you say you won't have?

    REGINA. I won't have any one find you here; so just you go about your
    business.

    ENGSTRAND. [Advances a step or two.] Blest if I go before I've had
    a talk with you. This afternoon I shall have finished my work at the
    school house, and then I shall take to-night's boat and be off home to
    the town.

    REGINA. [Mutters.] Pleasant journey to you!

    ENGSTRAND. Thank you, my child. To-morrow the Orphanage is to be opened,
    and then there'll be fine doings, no doubt, and plenty of intoxicating
    drink going, you know. And nobody shall say of Jacob Engstrand that he
    can't keep out of temptation's way.

    REGINA. Oh!

    ENGSTRAND. You see, there's to be heaps of grand folks here to-morrow.
    Pastor Manders is expected from town, too.

    REGINA. He's coming to-day.

    ENGSTRAND. There, you see! And I should be cursedly sorry if he found
    out anything against me, don't you understand?

    REGINA. Oho! is that your game?

    ENGSTRAND. Is what my game?

    REGINA. [Looking hard at him.] What are you going to fool Pastor Manders
    into doing, this time?

    ENGSTRAND. Sh! sh! Are you crazy? Do _I_ want to fool Pastor Manders? Oh
    no! Pastor Manders has been far too good a friend to me for that. But I
    just wanted to say, you know--that I mean to be off home again to-night.

    REGINA. The sooner the better, say I.

    ENGSTRAND. Yes, but I want you with me, Regina.

    REGINA. [Open-mouthed.] You want me--? What are you talking about?
