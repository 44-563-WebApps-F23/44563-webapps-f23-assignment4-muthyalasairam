    <p class="speech">What do you say you won't have?</p>
    <h6 class="REGINA">REGINA</h6>
    <p class="speech">I won't have any one find you here; so just you go about your business</p>
    <h6 class="ENGSTRAND">ENGSTRAND</h6>
    <p class="direction">[Advances a step or two.]</p>
    <p class="speech">Blest if I go before I've had
        a talk with you. This afternoon I shall have finished my work at the
        school house, and then I shall take to-night's boat and be off home to
        the town.</p> 

    <h6 class="ENGSTRAND">REGINA</h6> 
    <p class="direction">[Mutters.]</p> 
    <p class="speech">Pleasant journey to you!</p>
    
    <h6 class="ENGSTRAND">ENGSTRAND</h6>
    <p class="speech">Thank you, my child. To-morrow the Orphanage is to be opened,
        and then there'll be fine doings, no doubt, and plenty of intoxicating
        drink going, you know. And nobody shall say of Jacob Engstrand that he
        can't keep out of temptation's way.</p>

    <h6 class="REGINA">REGINA</h6> 
    <p class="speech">Oh!</p>
    
    <h6 class="ENGSTRAND">ENGSTRAND</h6>
    <p class="speech">You see, there's to be heaps of grand folks here to-morrow.
        Pastor Manders is expected from town, too.</p>

    <h6 class="REGINA">REGINA</h6> 
    <p class="speech">He's coming to-day.</p>

    <h6 class="ENGSTRAND">ENGSTRAND</h6> 
    <p class="speech">There, you see! And I should be cursedly sorry if he found
        out anything against me, don't you understand?</p>
